<h1>Hierarchy Creator</h1>
A python program allowing for custom hierarchies all from CLI.

One of the most time consuming projects I've ever tried.
This will also be integrated into my upcoming "pyos3" project.

<i>If you don't plan to use the release, run hierarchy.py.</li>
<i>You will also most likely need to install this package.</i>
<code>pip install console</code><br><br>
<b>Note! The source code uses operations designed for Unix (also works with macOS)!<br>Even though EXE releases are designed for Windows, if you plan to use the src you will need to convert the "clear" statement used in the cls() function in both hierarchy and func.py to your native terminals clear statement.<br>(This would be "cls" for Windows!)</b>
