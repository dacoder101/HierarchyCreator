<h1>Hierarchy Creator</h1>
A python program allowing for custom hierarchies all from CLI.

One of the most time consuming projects I've ever tried.
This will also be integrated into my upcoming "pyos3" project.

<i>If you don't plan to use the release, run hierarchy.py.</li>
<i>You will also most likely need to install this package.</i>
<code>pip install console</code>

<b>Note! The source code uses operations designed for LINUX!<br>Even though EXE releases are designed for Windows, if you plan to use the src you will need to convert all terminal operations to your OS.</b>
