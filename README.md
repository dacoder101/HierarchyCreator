# Hierarchy Creator
A python program allowing for custom hierarchies all from CLI.

One of the most time consuming projects I've ever tried.
This will also be integrated into my upcoming "Pyos3" project.

<i>You will most likely need to install this package if you do not plan to use the releases.</i>

<code>pip install console</code>

This project was developed on and can be found at <a href="https://replit.com/@bobbypac/Hierarchy-Creator" target="_blank">Replit</a>.
